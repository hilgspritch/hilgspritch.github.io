<p>I’m a woman living in Raleigh, NC with an incredible career and a lovely family.</p>

<p>I started this blog as a creative outlet to share my thoughts with people on the internet. </p>

<p>Spoiler alert: I'm an extrovert. When I meet someone for the first time and we make a connection or share a laugh, my reflex is to touch their arm. The extroverted version of me comes out most in small groups and intimate conversations. </p>

<p>The globe is getting smaller thanks to social media and this whole world wide web thing really taking off. I find my extroversion to be toned down here on the internet. Physical signals such as an arm touch don’t exist here. This blog allows me to express myself to friends I meet both in person and online. </p>

<p>I’ve been blogging on and off for about 10 years. Each time I would pick blogging back up, I’d tell myself that this time will be different. This time I will blog about this topic and I will do it this many times per week and I will write it using this tone. </p>

<p>I’m telling myself once again that this time will be different. I will be me. </p>

<p>No grand plans this time.  I'll figure it out as I go!</p>

<p>I felt the urge to whip this one up to learn about open source technology while writing down my thoughts about what’s going on in the world. Hope you enjoy.</p>
