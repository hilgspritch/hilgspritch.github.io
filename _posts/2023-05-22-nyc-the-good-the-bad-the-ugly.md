As I depart the fine city of New York and attempt to take back Raleigh, I have decided to compile a list of what I have loved about New York and the things that I have not so much loved and share that info with you all. So here it goes!

## The Good
- **Food trucks:** Mister Softee, Sabrett (hot dogs!), Halal and Greek food trucks. If you are having a craving for any of these items while in Manhattan just squint your eyes and one will be in reach, I guarantee it!
- **Delivery boys on bikes:** These guys have grace, coordination and absolutely no patience. The weave through the pedestrians and traffic as quickly as possible to deliver as many orders as possible in their shift to ensure maximum tips.
- **People's clothes:** I love walking through a happenin' neighborhood on a Friday or Saturday night, everyone is dressed up in what they think is the hottest outfit in their closet, and they are usually right. But the only way anyone's outfit here works is with their confidence. Therefore, anything goes in NYC!
- **Reading:** I have always liked to read okay, but with all of the waiting that has to be done here, I have found a new love for reading! You will see why when I write about "The Bad".
- **Random live music:** Whether it is the electric violinist in the Union Square subway station, the Metropolitan Opera at Battery City Park, the New York Philharmonic in Central Park, the bucket drummers at the 59th st station, the mariachi duo on the actual subway, or the Greek music that always seems to be playing in my neighborhood...you don't need to stand in line at TKTS to see a great musical, just walk down the street and you'll find some for free!
- **Sweet tea at McDonald's:** The ad says: "A $1 ticket to sweet tea land" I say: "A $1 ticket to NC!"
- **Third avenue:** Julie is soooo lucky to live near here! Tons of young urban professionals without the yuppie attitude. Fun places to drink like Blockheads and Joshua Tree, a go-to avenue for happy hour!
- **Dogs:** Teeny tiny dogs, small dogs, medium dogs, big dogs, and huge white fluffy dogs!! Dogs are everywhere!! New York dogs are the cutest, most well-behaved dogs in the country. Just sit by a dog park in Madison Square Park or Union Square and see for yourself...just beware of doggy doody :)
- **Bugaboo strollers:** Ergonomically correct and very city chic, if you are having a baby in New York, you must get this stroller!
- **Parks:** My three favorite parks are The High Line, Union Square and Madison Square Park. There is always always always something going on in Union Square (Japanese contortionists, evangelical Christian preachers, free hugs, trombonists, break dancing toddlers) and it houses my favorite thing of all: Union Square Farmer's Market!!
- **Shake Shack:** It is located in Madison Square Park and it is worth the wait. I once waited in line here by myself (I do most things alone anyway) for an hour. The best burgers and the best atmosphere!
- **Duane Reade and other drug stores:** Since there is no Target, we relish in our local drug store that has everything you need! Except for all the shit you waste your money on regularly at Target. So that is where New Yorkers $ave!
- **Bagels:** Another way New Yorkers save is bagels!!! They are the best!! My favorite bagel places are Ess-a-Bagel, Bagel Cafe and Hot Bagel. How will I live without New York bagels?
- **Flower shops:** When you are in New York, you have to take pleasure in the little things. In fact, most of my favorite things about the city are the little pleasures it has to offer. One of my favorites is walking down the street along a flower shop and just taking a big whiff of the lovely flowers!
- **Restaurants:** I don't even know where to begin with the food in this city. It is just the best. NC has Bojangle's and BBQ and don't get me wrong, nothing compares to those staples, but this city has it all! My top three are Penelope, Les Halles and Cafeteria. I also very much enjoyed Blue Water Grill, Max Brenner, Haru and Mesa.
- **Chinatown:** The cheapest eats! Prosperity Dumpling has a menu where everything is $1...10 dumplings for $1!!
- **Bars:** Brother Jimmy's is definitely up there on my list because that is where us North Carolinians feel most at home! The Swamp Water is so much fun! I also found they had the best happy hour: $2 GOOD margs! Frying Pan, McSorley's and Chelsea Brewery were also a hoot!
- **Diners:** Julie and I once had a fabulous celebration with pina coladas at Moonstruck (a diner in her neighborhood). I enjoy getting the portobello foccacia at Tastee Corner (a diner in my neighborhood) because it is huge and comes with fries and soup. Very Tastee!!
- **Museums:** The Met is the best! It is just the best. I love it.
- **Brunch:** This I am definitely taking with me when I go home to Raleigh. New Yorkers may be go go go go Monday through Friday, but come the weekend, they are the most relaxed Americans! Sleep til noon, stroll over to brunch at two and enjoy an afternoon shopping or
in the park. Arte Pasta had the best deal with $5 unlimited mimosas and a fantastic eggs benedict! Penelope is also an all-time favorite.
- My favorite neighborhoods: Murray Hill/Gramercy/Flatiron, SoHo, West Village, Upper West Side
- **Bloomingdale's:** We have a love/love relationship. I love all the brands and designers that this department store has to offer and it loves my money. Marc Jacobs, French Connection, DVF, Alice + Olivia, Michael Stars, Michael Kors, Tibi, Chanel, La Perla, Betsey Johnson, Calvin Klein, Rebecca Taylor, designer denim, designer shoes, designer handbags, designer housewares, designer furniture...oh the list never ends. The staff is friendly and helpful and wants you to spend! But they also want you to look fabulous :)

## The Bad
- **Waiting for the subway:** This activity seems to last forever, especially if you do not have a book! But there is nothing worse than waiting for the subway, except for the rest of this list.
- **A crowded subway:** Especially in the summer, there is nothing worse than a crowded subway of people who who do not know how to use deodorant. It also sucks when people do not know how to hold on to the hand rails and fall on you on their way to the ground.
- **A slow subway:** "Ladies and gentlemen we are delayed because of train traffic ahead of us" Have you guys ever seen the episode of Seinfeld where they are all on the subway? And Elaine is stuck on the subway? Yeah so I totally feel for her rage.
- **Herald Square:** It is the worst square of them all. Way too crowded and packed with Search Lauren Home Createdumb tourists. Notice how I said "dumb tourists" not just "tourists". A lot of tourists are totally tolerable, but when they are dumb and in Herald Square...it is excruciating.
- **Naked lady in Loft:** I don't really know what else to say about this because that is what happened to me one day. Not in the dressing room, in the entrance vestibule. That is not an appropriate place to be naked!
- **Solicitors:** "Can I ask you a question about your hair?" WTF?!?! No you may not! I have a tip for anyone going to NYC: do not make eye contact with those who are holding
clipboards. They will do their best to make eye contact with you and smile to make you think that you know them...but you don't. They just want to waste your time and make you feel bad for not donating to their cause.
- **Times Square:** Unless you get a seat, it is an anxiety attack waiting to happen.
- **Rain:** There is nothing worse (besides ice) than getting caught in the rain in New York. Except if you are waiting to cross the street and a car speeds through the puddle in front of you and showers you with dirty street water.

## The Ugly:
A lot of you could come and visit me or live in NYC or lived in NYC and were able to share items on the above list with me. However, the things on this list were only enjoyed the most when shared with someone. Without friends, no matter where you are in the world, it just is not as much fun.
