In a fast-paced world where simplicity seemed elusive, I embarked on a quest for a streamlined lifestyle back in 2017. Juggling the responsibilities of being a full-time working mom to a lively two-year-old daughter, I yearned for a touch of tranquility. I wouldn't have guessed that my journey to simplicity would lead me to discover the power of fashion as a means of self-expression. In this post, I will share with you how I found my personal style amidst the chaos and embraced the freedom it brought.



Amidst my search for a simplified existence, I stumbled upon the concept of a capsule wardrobe. The idea of reducing decision fatigue and embracing a more minimalist approach intrigued me. With this newfound inspiration, I resolved to give it a try, determined to streamline my daily routine and reclaim some precious moments.



Armed with the desire to make my mornings easier, I selected a versatile button-up shirtâ€”a true wardrobe staple. Side note: my mom raised me to forsake the creeds of dry clean only or lay flat to dry. Those dogmas were against her religion. So I checked the label of the synthetic fiber blouse and read: Machine wash cold. Tumble dry low. Ding ding ding! It's a winner. Encouraged by my enthusiasm, I purchased the same shirt in five colors, envisioning a capsule wardrobe that would simplify my life while elevating my style effortlessly.



As the first week rolled by, I eagerly embraced my capsule wardrobe experiment. Mornings became a breeze as I reached for my trusty wrinkle-free shirt, paired it with a comfortable pair of jeans, and effortlessly curated a polished ensemble. The initial joy and ease brought a newfound sense of control to my daily routine.



However, it wasn't long before I discovered a flaw in my grand plan. As I entered the bustling office environment, the monotony of my uniform capsule wardrobe began to drain my energy. A craving for self-expression tugged at my heart, reminding me that fashion was my chosen medium to convey my individuality and creativity to the world. I found myself putting all my energy into my accessories, jewelry, and shoes. And that felt no different than when I put energy into the apparel itself.



Finally, I realized that clothes were more than mere garments. They were my canvas for self-expression, my avenue to showcase my personality, and my tool to convey my emotions. The idea of confining myself to a capsule wardrobe stifled my spirit and limited the way I expressed myself.



Realizing the true essence of fashion in my life, I bid farewell to the constraints of a capsule wardrobe. I embraced the boundless possibilities that awaited me each morning as I opened my wardrobe to a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and styles. I looked at my clothing with a new, more grateful view. Fashion became an adventure, an ever-evolving reflection of my ever-changing moods and aspirations.



Through my capsule wardrobe experiment, I discovered that choosing my outfit was not a burden to be simplified but a vibrant path through which I could communicate my innermost self. It taught me that there is beauty in embracing my ever-changing desires and expressing myself authentically. If I am feeling stressed, I gain control in choosing my look for the day. I use my clothing as a public-facing signal whether I'm cheering on my favorite team, protesting some right-wing nonsense, emulating my favorite pop star, or experimenting with a trend. I love to mix and match new pieces and vintage pieces. As long as the item in my closet speaks to me, it serves a purpose in my life. Today, my wardrobe embodies my unique journey, a testament to the joyous freedom I found when I let style be my guide.



*Are you left wondering how I ended up simplifying my life? Though fashion wasn't the answer, it was lunch. Is there any adult out there who actually enjoys deciding what to eat for lunch? I'd much prefer making lunch for my kids than for myself. So when I go to the office, I eat lunch in the cafeteria, where decisions are made for me. At home, I make my go-to black bean burger quesadilla. I'm now free from lunch decision-making, and it feels good.*
